An \egraph efficiently represents
  a congruence relation over many expressions.
Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s
  for use in automated theorem provers,
  a more recent technique known as \textit{equality saturation}
  repurposes \egraphs to implement state-of-the-art,
  rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers.
However, \egraphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case.
Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and
  often require ad~hoc \egraph extensions to
  incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.

This work contributes two techniques that make
  \egraphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation.
A new amortized invariant restoration technique called \textit{rebuilding}
  takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload,
  providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice.
A general mechanism called \textit{\eclass analyses}
  integrates domain-specific analyses into the \egraph,
  reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.

We implemented these techniques in
  a new open-source library called \egg.
Our case studies on
  three previously published applications of equality saturation
  highlight how \egg's performance and flexibility
  enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.
