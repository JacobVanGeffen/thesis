\chapter{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case-studies}

This thesis makes the case that equality saturation
 (and \egg in particular)
 is the right tool for
 many program optimization and synthesis tasks.
The preceding chapters have articulated the
 technical novelties, practical features,
 and quantitative evidence that supports this claim.
This section provides qualitative evidence through case studies
 of independently-developed, published\footnotemark{}
 projects from diverse domains
 that incorporated \egg.

In some cases, the developers had first rolled their own \egraph
 implementations;
 \egg allowed them to delete code, gain performance, and in some cases
 dramatically broaden the project's scope thanks to \egg's speed and
 flexibility.
In addition to gaining performance, all projects use \egg's novel
  extensibility features like \eclass analyses and dynamic/conditional rewrites.
