\chapter{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:conclusion}

To conclude this thesis,
 we should return to our
 original goal of
 supporting the thesis statement
 stated in \autoref{sec:intro}:
\begin{quote}
  \it\Thesisstmt
\end{quote}
There are a few important parts of this statement,
 and teasing them apart
 may help us figure out if
 we have done what we set out to do.

First, we start out with
 ``e-graphs and equality saturation \emph{are} compelling techniques [\ldots]''.
This introductory phrase deserves to stand alone.
Both the core technique discussed in this thesis
 and the data structure that powers it
 are exciting, well-developed prior work.
My hope is that the document as a whole---and the
 background in \autoref{sec:background} in
 particular---get this point across to the reader.
In the course of advancing the state-of-the-art
 in these areas,
 it is necessary to focus on their shortcomings,
 but hopefully this phrase expresses
 how just how tall these shoulders are.
Had I not been excited by these works,
 this thesis would not exist.

Second, we have
 ``e-graphs and equality saturation [\ldots] should \emph{now} be considered [\ldots]''.
This is not to say that they are not without merit on their own,
 but rather that I hope the advances introduced in this thesis
 help raise the profile of \eqsat as a compelling technique.
Chapters \ref{sec:rebuilding} and \ref{sec:extensions}
 present new approaches that makes \eqsat faster and more flexible,
 alleviating two key concerns with that a prospective user may have.
\autoref{sec:egg} introduces \egg,
 the tool that implements all of this
 and make \eqsat easier to use than ever before.
Put together, I believe these contributions make \emph{now}
 the time to look into and use \eqsat.

Finally, we end by stating that \eqsat should be applicable to
 ``[\ldots] programming tools across many domains.''
My goal for this thesis is to turn
 many ``why'' questions about equality saturation into ``why not'' questions.
The case studies in \autoref{sec:case-studies}
 hopefully offer empirical evidence that
 \eqsat can be useful (and even critical)
 in unexpected ways.
If the same technique can shrink 3D CAD programs (\autoref{sec:szalinski}),
 make floating point more accurate (\autoref{sec:herbie}),
 optimize deep learning compute graphs (\autoref{sec:tensat}),
 and synthesize the very rules that it needs to work (\autoref{sec:ruler}),
 then why wouldn't it work for your problem in your domain?
Even outside of those case studies,
 \egg is powering or inspiring many additional projects,
 only some of which are published at the time of writing
 this~\cite{spores, Cheli2021, vanhattum2021vectorization}.


People used and worked on equality saturation before
 I began work on this thesis.
In fact,
 I first learned about it by
 talking to some of those people (the Herbie developers, \autoref{sec:herbie}).
My first reaction
 to equality saturation was that of a skeptic (``it's just unionfind''),
 and I began
 work on \egg out of hubris to show that it was trivial to implement.
Predictably, I was quickly humbled,
 but eventually \egg became a useful tool.
After some more learning,
 I moved into the fanatic phase: ``why isn't everyone doing this?''
Through the course of pushing a round \egg through several square holes,
 I would like to think that I have adopted a more pragmatic approach,\footnote{
   Friends and colleagues, however, will be excused for still thinking
   me a fanatic. \includegraphics[height=1em]{egg.png}
}
 informed by the strengths and weaknesses of the technique.

This work in this thesis puts a dent in those weaknesses
 and introduces some new strengths.
With these advances,
 and with \egg packaging them all up,
 I hope that others find that equality saturation
 is a viable, useful, and even fun
 technique with a more straightforward journey than my own.
