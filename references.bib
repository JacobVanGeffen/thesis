  abstract="Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers have proven highly scalable, efficient and suitable for integrating theory reasoning. However, for numerous applications from program analysis and verification, the ground fragment is insufficient, as proof obligations often include quantifiers. A well known approach for quantifier reasoning uses a matching algorithm that works against an E-graph to instantiate quantified variables. This paper introduces algorithms that identify matches on E-graphs incrementally and efficiently. In particular, we introduce an index that works on E-graphs, called E-matching code trees that combine features of substitution and code trees, used in saturation based theorem provers. E-matching code trees allow performing matching against several patterns simultaneously. The code trees are combined with an additional index, called the inverted path index, which filters E-graph terms that may potentially match patterns when the E-graph is updated. Experimental results show substantial performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art SMT solvers.",

    abstract="The performance of modern Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers relies crucially on efficient decision procedures as well as static simplification techniques, which include large sets of rewrite rules. Manually discovering and implementing rewrite rules is challenging. In this work, we propose a framework that uses enumerative syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) to propose rewrite rules that are not implemented in a given SMT solver. We implement this framework in cvc4, a state-of-the-art SMT and SyGuS solver, and evaluate several use cases. We show that some SMT solvers miss rewriting opportunities, or worse, have bugs in their rewriters. We also show that a variation of our approach can be used to test the correctness of a rewriter. Finally, we show that rewrites discovered with this technique lead to significant improvements in cvc4 on both SMT and SyGuS problems over bit-vectors and strings.",

The schema satisfiability problem and schema validity problem are shown to be ≤mlog-complete for NP and co-NP, respectively. Finally, the problem of isomorphism of finitely presented algebras is shown to be polynomial time many-one equivalent to the problem of graph isomorphism.},

abstract = {The notion of the congruence closure of a relation on a graph is defined and several algorithms for computing it are surveyed. A simple proof is given that the congruence closure algorithm provides a decision procedure for the quantifier-free theory of equality. A decision procedure is then given for the quantifier-free theory of LISP list structure based on the congruence closure algorithm. Both decision procedures determine the satisfiability of a conjunction of literals of length n in average time O(n log n) using the fastest known congruence closure algorithm. It is also shown that if the axiomatization of the theory of list structure is changed slightly, the problem of determining the satisfiability of a conjunction of literals becomes NP-complete. The decision procedures have been implemented in the authors' simplifier for the Stanford Pascal Verifier.},

abstract = { Developing an optimizing compiler backend remains a laborious process, especially for nontraditional ISAs that have been appearing recently. Superoptimization sidesteps the need for many code transformations by searching for the most optimal instruction sequence semantically equivalent to the original code fragment. Even though superoptimization discovers the best machine-specific code optimizations, it has yet to become widely-used. We propose GreenThumb, an extensible framework that reduces the cost of constructing superoptimizers and provides a fast search algorithm that can be reused for any ISA, exploiting the unique strengths of enumerative, stochastic, and symbolic (SAT-solver-based) search algorithms. To extend GreenThumb to a new ISA, it is only necessary to implement an emulator for the ISA and provide some ISA-specific search utility functions. },
